Goal: Create a simple web app that list users information from an API with ReactJs (~2h)

1) Create 2 simple html pages: "List page" + "Description page"
2) Fetch users on this endpoint -> "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users" and list the result on the "List page"
3) When clicking on a user on the list, it goes to the "description page" of the user fetched. Ex for user with ID 1 you need to fetch "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1"
4) You are totally free on the UI, don't spend time making it super fancy, but make it good enough.
Feel free (and recommended) to use a css frameworks (bulma, tailwind, bootstrap,...)
